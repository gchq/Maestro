 * An {@code IExamplesServiceV2} has methods to produce example {@link Operation}s to be applied
 * to the methods in {@link uk.gov.gchq.maestro.rest.service.v2.IOperationServiceV2}.
 * Each example method path should be equal to the corresponding IOperationService method with /example as a prefix.
 * Each example method should return a populated {@link Operation} which can be used to call the
 * corresponding IOperationService method.
 * <p>
 * Ideally the example should work against any {@link uk.gov.gchq.maestro.Executor},
 * however this may not be possible in all cases - but it should at least give a starting point for
 * constructing a valid {@link Operation}.
